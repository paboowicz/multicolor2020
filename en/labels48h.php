                            <h3>Short production series at attractive prices</h3>
                            <p>Our new line of booklet labels LABELS48h enables production of any short series up to 5000 pieces at attractive prices that are characteristic of large series. Due to our new production technology we have optimized the unit cost of production.</p>
                            <br>
                            <h3>High quality printing</h3>
                            <p>All components of labels, i.e. both base labels and inserts, are printed using the same technology, i.e. offset printing, what results in very high print resolution that is uniform for the entire product and provides excellent legibility of the information contained in the labels. </p>
                            <br>
                            <h3>Express customization and design</h3>

                            <h3>Variable marking of labels and additional safeguards</h3>
                            <p>In our new design line of labels, LABELS48H, we have introduced the templates that facilitate variable marking using the industrial printing technology. Additionally, we offer also other solutions that protect against unauthorized opening of the label and against counterfeit products.</p>
                            <br>
                            <h3>Ecology</h3>
                            <p>All labels from the line LABELS48H are more eco-friendly since we have replaced flexo printing with offset printing in our technological process. Moreover, some selected labels can be easily recycled as they are made entirely of one material.</p>
                            <br>
                            <h3>Guaranteed Multicolor quality </h3>
                            <p>The automated quality control for our new line of products, LABELS48H, facilitates quick and at the same time reliable detection of any product faults what is essential for our labels to be of highest quality and for the production time to be shortened. </p>
